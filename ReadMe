Instructions:

The current application is displaying a list of nodes. Don’t worry about naming convention here, the names don’t matter. Each node represents a server. Each server implements the same API but returns different data. The important endpoints you will need to know for each server are:

/api/v1/status
/api/v1/blocks

Each node has many blocks and the blocks for each node are returned from the blocks endpoint.

Currently the application is displaying the list of nodes in a TableView.  We would like to retreive the status of each node when the view loads and retreive the blocks for a node when the node is opened.

Acceptance criteria:

1. Update the status of each node when the view loads
2. Blocks are displayed when opening up the card if the status of the node is "online"
3. Loading, error, empty states are displayed when appropriate
3. Tests pass and coverage has been added to cover the changes
4. Implementation matches the design [https://www.figma.com/proto/CCuZ0sjGQ2CQtKvuENHaF8/React-Hiring-Test?node-id=11%3A26922&scaling=min-zoom]
